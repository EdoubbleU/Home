# Survivethehood
So yeah this is my first attempt at coding, let s see where this goes.

I've been reading about C# on and off for a long time *cough (4 years). 
I never attempted at creating a project until. A friend of mine suggested
I start following a tutorial and my passion was re-lit. 
The game is called survive the hood and its a small rpg you survice through.
I'm still in the process of building the game and following the tutorial.
The tutorial can be found here: https://scottlilly.com/build-a-cwpf-rpg/
